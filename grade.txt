We would like to argue a 70%

While we were unable to get the project fully working we did implement most of the required implementations.
We were able to create threads that have a shared address space. Each thread also has a seperate stack, in which their arguments
were added to. Each thread could also access the heap space showing that each thread has a shared memory space.
We also showed that joining the threads worked in the desired way.

We also believe that being a group of two with only a week to implment our design was a disadvantage. Had we had more time or
a third group member, we believe we were very close to implementing a fully working project which would have allowed us
to argue for a 100%.
